##  Speeding up Traffic Jams: A Participatory Simulation for Learning how to Drive in Congested Conditions
This project is designed to help people explore and understand how individual driving behaviors affect overall traffic flow. This document provides a clear overview: it explains the purpose of the simulation, who it is intended for, who participates in it, how long it typically lasts, how to operate it, and how it can contribute to our daily lives. Using the results and data obtained from the simulation, participants and educators can draw meaningful conclusions and lessons that impact real-world driving habits and help us all drive more safely and efficiently.

##  Purpose of the Simulation  
The purpose of the simulation is to teach safe and efficient driving strategies in an engaging, experiential way, while highlighting the social importance of rational driving in reducing congestion, pollution, and frustration.

In the simulation:  
•	Each participant controls a single car through a client interface, while a teacher oversees the simulation.  
•	Students experiment with different driving strategies in a congested road environment, comparing results such as average vehicle speed and traffic stability.  

Through hands-on play and discussion, participants discover important insights:  
•	Traffic often behaves like a wave.  
•	A single driver braking suddenly can create phantom traffic jams.  
•	Maintaining a steady distance and reducing unnecessary lane changes improves flow.  
•	Safe and rational driving not only prevents accidents, but also results in faster travel overall.  


##  Technical information    
•	The simulation is intended for 11th grade students.    
•	Estimated simulation time is 3-5 minutes.

##  How it contributes to our daily lives
By experimenting with the simulation, participants gain a deeper understanding of how their personal driving choices influence overall traffic conditions. The activity shows that sudden braking, unnecessary lane changes, or inconsistent speeds can create “phantom” traffic jams that ripple backward and slow everyone down. In contrast, driving steadily, keeping a safe distance, and maintaining rational speed reduces congestion, prevents accidents, and allows traffic to flow more smoothly. These lessons go beyond the classroom: they help us realize that safe and considerate driving is not only good for individual safety, but also improves the collective experience on the road, saving time, lowering frustration, and even reducing pollution.


##  How to Download the runing file
#### Instructions for the teacher-  

First, download the file named "TrafficJams_HubNet_Web.hnw.json" :
1. Click on the file name –"TrafficJams_HubNet_Web.hnw.json"
2. On the right side of the screen, click on the next icon (when you hover it – you will see "Download raw file")  <br>
<img width="70" height="77" alt="download" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecccc5ca-8e52-45a9-ab0d-6a6dc991a867" />
<br>
3. Pay attention to where you save the file


## How to open the simulation
After downloading, follow these instructions:
1. Open the following link - https://hubnetweb.org/host 
2. Click on "Your Own Model" button and then on "יש לבחור קבצים"
3. Navigate to the location where the previously downloaded file is saved (named "TrafficJams_HubNet_Web.hnw.json") and double-click on it (or click on it + the "Open" button)
4. At the bottom of the page are two fields "Session Name" and "Password".
- In the "Session Name" field, write your school name + date, as follows: SchoolName 8.8.25
- In the "Password" field, choose a password of your choice, such as 1234 or 0000, etc.

## How to setup and start the simulation:
#### Instructions for the teacher-
1. Click the blue button on the top left called "Copy invite link"  (after you click on it, the caption will change to "Copied!") -   


<br>
<img width="1270" height="573" alt="Screenshot3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73666da7-5aa4-4db1-adda-4937ed5a62af" />  






 
2. Send the copied link in a shared group with all the students (WhatsApp, class forum, etc), the link is already copied, so just press Ctrl + V or right-click with the mouse + "paste"

3. Adjust the buttons according to the following instructions:  
---------------This section should follow the instructions of Prof. Sharona T. Levy---------------

4. Click the upper "Setup" blue button ( the one inside the red rectangle), and the screen will now look like this-  

<br>
<img width="1551" height="707" alt="Screenshot4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c6e4cb-6c2b-41bf-b620-b4e7f4b4aec1" />  






5. After all the students have joined -> click the "Go" button, and the simulation will start running -  

<br>

6. To end the simulation, click the same "Go"  button again -> which will cause the screen to stop and the simulation to end.
7. In order to save and download the data files saved during the simulation click on the two buttons on the bottom left -  
- Click on "Save Init CSV" 
- Click on "Save Run CSV"
