###  Speeding up Traffic Jams: A Participatory Simulation for Learning how to Drive in Congested Conditions
This project is designed to help people explore and understand how individual driving behaviors affect overall traffic flow. This document provides a clear overview: it explains the purpose of the simulation, who it is intended for, who participates in it, how long it typically lasts, how to operate it, and how it can contribute to our daily lives. Using the results and data obtained from the simulation, participants and educators can draw meaningful conclusions and lessons that impact real-world driving habits and help us all drive more safely and efficiently.

##  Purpose of the Simulation
In the simulation:  
•	Each participant controls a single car through a client interface, while a teacher oversees the simulation.  
•	Students experiment with different driving strategies in a congested road environment, comparing results such as average vehicle speed and traffic stability.  

Through hands-on play and discussion, participants discover important insights:
•	Traffic often behaves like a wave.  
•	A single driver braking suddenly can create phantom traffic jams.  
•	Maintaining a steady distance and reducing unnecessary lane changes improves flow.  
•	Safe and rational driving not only prevents accidents, but also results in faster travel overall.
